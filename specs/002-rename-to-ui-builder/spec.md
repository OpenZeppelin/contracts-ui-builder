# Feature Specification: Rename to 'UI Builder'

**Feature Branch**: `002-rename-to-ui-builder`
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Input**: User description: "Rename to 'UI Builder'. Rename this whole monorepo from 'Contracts UI Builder' to 'UI Builder'. That includes user facing parts first of all, and then everything internally: comments, docs, codebase, package names etc."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a stakeholder and end user, I want the product to be consistently named "UI Builder" across all user-facing surfaces so that communication, documentation, and the application experience are aligned and unambiguous. The legacy name "Contracts UI Builder" should no longer appear in active user-facing content.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new user views public documentation and the repository README, **When** they read titles, headings, badges, and copy, **Then** they only see the product referred to as "UI Builder" with no remaining "Contracts UI Builder" references in user-facing content.
2. **Given** a user opens the application, **When** they navigate through pages, dialogs, toasts, and headers, **Then** all product mentions use "UI Builder" consistently.
3. **Given** a developer examines packages and registry entries, **When** they view package names, import paths, descriptions, and deprecation notices, **Then** legacy packages are clearly deprecated and new packages exist with updated names that use "UI Builder"; package metadata reflects the new brand.
4. **Given** a user exports a standalone app or artifact, **When** they inspect the exported UI and any included README/text, **Then** the product name used is "UI Builder".
5. **Given** historical documents such as old changelogs or past release notes, **When** users review earlier records, **Then** historical references may retain "Contracts UI Builder" for accuracy while current content reflects "UI Builder".
6. **Given** the repository and associated URLs, **When** users view the repository name/slug and any first-party links, **Then** they reflect the new naming (removing "contracts") and remain discoverable.
7. **Given** search across the repository, **When** scanning user-facing content, **Then** there are no unintentional remaining instances of "Contracts UI Builder".
8. **Given** a code search for component/class/function/file/directory names containing the legacy brand (e.g., `ContractsUIBuilder`), **When** the rename is executed, **Then** identifiers, filenames, and directory names are updated to use "UIBuilder" (or appropriate new naming) and all references/imports are consistent.

### Edge Cases

- Historical artifacts (older changelogs entries, past release notes) may intentionally retain the legacy name for historical integrity.
- Third-party references (blogs, external docs) cannot be updated and are out of scope.
- Repository name/slug and related first-party URLs will be updated; ensure references are aligned to the new slug.
- npm package names and import paths will be renamed; legacy packages will be deprecated with migration notes linking to new packages.
- The brand qualifier "OpenZeppelin UI Builder" is used only where the prior form was "OpenZeppelin Contracts UI Builder"; elsewhere use "UI Builder".
- Backwards compatibility will not be provided; users are expected to migrate to the new package names.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: All user-facing content MUST use the product name "UI Builder".
- **FR-002**: The legacy name "Contracts UI Builder" MUST be removed from current user-facing surfaces (docs, app UI, exports, examples, marketing copy), except where preserved for historical accuracy.
- **FR-003**: Application UI copy (titles, navigation labels, dialog headings, notifications) MUST consistently use "UI Builder".
- **FR-004**: Public documentation (README, docs site pages, badges alt text, repository description) MUST consistently use "UI Builder".
- **FR-005**: Exported artifacts (e.g., generated applications, ZIP filenames, embedded README or text) MUST reference "UI Builder".
- **FR-006**: Registry package names and import paths MUST be renamed; legacy packages MUST be deprecated in npm with clear migration notes linking to new packages and a brief rationale for the change.
- **FR-007**: Repository name/slug and related first-party URLs MUST be updated to remove "contracts" and reflect the new naming; internal references MUST be aligned accordingly.
- **FR-008**: Where the prior brand was "OpenZeppelin Contracts UI Builder", the updated brand SHOULD be "OpenZeppelin UI Builder"; elsewhere use "UI Builder".
- **FR-009**: Code comments and inline documentation SHOULD refer to "UI Builder" consistently (non-user-facing but part of internal consistency scope).
- **FR-010**: CI/CD and release automation MUST be updated to publish under new package names and to apply deprecation to legacy packages.
- **FR-011**: Migration guidance MUST be visible on legacy npm package pages with links to the new packages; no backwards compatibility is required.
- **FR-012**: A naming policy MUST be applied to remove "contracts" from names and slugs (e.g., `contracts-ui-builder-types` ‚Üí `ui-builder-types`).
- **FR-013**: Before release, a quality check MUST confirm no unintended "Contracts UI Builder" strings remain in current user-facing content.
- **FR-014**: Code identifiers (component names, classes, functions) and file/directory names that embed the legacy brand MUST be renamed to the new naming (e.g., `ContractsUIBuilder` ‚Üí `UIBuilder`), and all imports/references MUST be updated consistently across the codebase.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Product Name (New)**: "UI Builder" ‚Äî canonical brand string for all current content.
- **Product Name (Legacy)**: "Contracts UI Builder" ‚Äî legacy term to be deprecated in current content.
- **Naming Policy**: Remove the term "contracts" from names and slugs across repository, packages, and internal references (e.g., `contracts-ui-builder-types` ‚Üí `ui-builder-types`).
- **Package Migration**: Legacy packages deprecated on npm with migration notes linking to new packages; new packages published under updated names; no backwards compatibility.
- **Repository and URLs**: Repository name/slug and first-party URLs updated to reflect the new naming; references updated accordingly.
- **Brand Qualifier Policy**: Use "OpenZeppelin UI Builder" only where the previous usage was "OpenZeppelin Contracts UI Builder"; otherwise use "UI Builder".
- **Code Identifier & Path Mapping**: Mapping of legacy ‚Üí new component/class/function names and file/directory paths (e.g., `packages/builder/src/components/ContractsUIBuilder/*` ‚Üí `.../UIBuilder/*`).
