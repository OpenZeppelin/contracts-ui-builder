# Adapter Parity Requirements Quality Checklist: EVM & Stellar

**Purpose**: Validate that requirements ensure parity with EVM/Stellar adapters
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: ./../spec.md

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are parity targets explicitly stated for each phase (wallet, ingestion, auto views, write + export)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-010; User Stories]
- [x] CHK002 Are mapping/type handling expectations aligned with EVM/Stellar (field types, defaults)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003–FR-006, §FR-018]
- [x] CHK003 Are transaction lifecycle requirements aligned (status messaging, identifiers)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007, FR-013]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK004 Is the scope of v1 limitations (wallet-only, no param views) clearly compared to EVM/Stellar? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011; User Story 3]
- [x] CHK005 Is export parity defined (packages, config, behavior equivalence)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-015]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK006 Do acceptance scenarios mirror EVM/Stellar flow patterns where applicable? [Consistency, Spec §User Stories]
- [x] CHK007 Do plan test structures mirror EVM/Stellar test layout? [Consistency, Plan §Project Structure/tests]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK008 Are cross-adapter measurable outcomes consistent (timings, success rates)? [Acceptance, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK009 Are alternate/exception flows covered similarly to EVM/Stellar (cancel, reject, invalid inputs)? [Coverage, Spec §Acceptance]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK010 Are adapter-specific edge cases documented without breaking parity (no explorer, indexing delays)? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK011 Are parity dependencies documented (e.g., dependency sync policy vs. export manifest)? [Dependencies, Spec §FR-017, Export Manifest]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK012 Are any intentional deviations from EVM/Stellar documented with rationale (e.g., no relayer in v1)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-011]
