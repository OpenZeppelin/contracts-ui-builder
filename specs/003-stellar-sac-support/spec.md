# Feature Specification: Stellar SAC Support

**Feature Branch**: `003-stellar-sac-support`  
**Created**: [Auto-generated on branch creation]  
**Status**: Ready for implementation  
**Input**: User description: "Stellar SAC Support: Add SAC detection via RPC, fetch official spec from stellar/stellar-asset-contract-spec at refs/heads/main, convert JSON to XDR with @stellar/stellar-xdr-json and lossless-json, construct contract.Spec for method discovery; support only public/testnet; runtime fetch with TanStack Query caching; no spec overrides; adapter changes isolated to loader and new sac modules; unit/integration tests; docs & changelog."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24

- Q: How long should the SAC spec be cached in the session? ‚Üí A: No TTL (TanStack defaults)

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story

As a user interacting with Soroban contracts in the Builder, I want to load and interact with Stellar Asset Contract (SAC) instances by entering a contract ID, so that I can discover available methods and invoke read/write operations just like regular Soroban contracts.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a valid Stellar SAC contract ID on public/testnet, **When** the user loads the contract in the Builder, **Then** the app should automatically detect it is a SAC and display its methods for interaction.
2. **Given** a SAC contract loaded in the Builder, **When** the user selects a method and provides inputs, **Then** the app should allow querying (read) and transaction execution (write) consistent with non-SAC contracts.
3. **Given** a network outage or GitHub unavailability, **When** the user attempts to load a SAC, **Then** the app should show a clear error message explaining the SAC spec could not be fetched and invite the user to retry.
4. **Given** a non-SAC contract ID, **When** the user loads the contract, **Then** the app should proceed with the normal contract loading flow and show methods as usual.
5. **Given** the user loads the same SAC contract ID multiple times within a session, **When** the spec has already been fetched, **Then** the app should use the cached spec and load immediately without redundant fetches.

### Edge Cases

- Contract ID is invalid or from an unsupported network ‚Üí show validation error and prevent load.
- RPC returns an unknown/unsupported executable type ‚Üí show a descriptive error and do not load methods.
- The fetched spec is malformed or incompatible ‚Üí surface a user-friendly error and avoid partial UI.
- User switches between public and testnet networks with the same SAC contract ID ‚Üí re-evaluate using the active network and fetch/cached spec accordingly.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST detect whether a provided contract ID refers to a Stellar Asset Contract (SAC) on supported networks (public, testnet only).
- **FR-002**: When a SAC is detected, the system MUST fetch the official SAC contract specification from the Stellar-maintained public source.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST present SAC methods to users for discovery, input, and invocation in the same way as for regular Soroban contracts.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST support read (query) and write (transaction) interactions with SAC using the discovered methods and parameter schemas.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST cache the fetched SAC specification within the application's session to avoid redundant network requests and improve responsiveness (use TanStack Query defaults; no explicit TTL override).
- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide clear, actionable error messages when SAC detection, spec retrieval, or method discovery fails, without crashing the application.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST limit support to Stellar public and testnet networks for this iteration.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST avoid requiring developers to author or maintain the SAC spec; the official published source is sufficient.
- **FR-009**: The system SHOULD maintain parity of user experience (fields, validation, results formatting) between SAC and non-SAC contracts.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001 (Performance)**: On cache hit, method discovery MUST complete in < 1s measured at the adapter boundary.
- **NFR-002 (Responsiveness)**: On SAC fetch failure, an actionable error MUST be surfaced within < 3s.
- **NFR-003 (Stability)**: SAC interaction MUST not degrade non-SAC flows; no increase in error rate vs baseline.

### Key Entities

- **SAC Contract**: A deployed instance of the Stellar Asset Contract identified by a contract ID on public/testnet networks.
- **SAC Specification**: The canonical interface description for SAC, defining its callable methods and data types, obtained from the official Stellar source.
- **User Session Cache**: An application-scoped in-memory cache that stores the previously fetched SAC specification for quick reuse in the same session.
