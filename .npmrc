# PRIVATE REGISTRY CONFIGURATION
# ===============================
# Currently using organization-level scoping to route ALL @openzeppelin packages
# to the private GitHub registry. This includes both:
# - Private packages (contracts-ui-builder-*)
# - Public dependencies (@openzeppelin/relayer-sdk)
#
# This approach requires ALL @openzeppelin packages to be available in the private registry.
# Public packages like @openzeppelin/relayer-sdk must be manually published to the private registry.

@openzeppelin:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}

# TRANSITION TO PUBLIC RELEASE
# =============================
# When ready to publish packages publicly, make these changes:
# 1. Remove the @openzeppelin:registry line above
# 2. Update release workflows to publish to npm instead of GitHub registry
# 3. All package names and imports will remain the same
#
# After transition, the .npmrc should only contain:
# shamefully-hoist=true
# strict-peer-dependencies=false
# auto-install-peers=true
