# PRIVATE REGISTRY RELEASE WORKFLOW
# ==================================
# This workflow handles both CI and publishing for the private registry.
# All @openzeppelin packages (including dependencies) are resolved from the private registry
# due to organization-level scoping in .npmrc.
#
# AUTHENTICATION:
# The workflow uses the NPM_TOKEN secret for authentication to GitHub Package Registry.
# This should be a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `read:packages` and `write:packages`
# permissions to avoid GitHub Package Registry permission limitations.
#
# TRANSITION TO PUBLIC RELEASE:
# When ready to publish publicly, update this workflow to:
# 1. Update the .npmrc authentication to use NPM_TOKEN for npm registry
# 2. Update the Changesets publish command to target npm registry
# 3. Ensure .npmrc is updated (see .npmrc comments)
# 4. All package names and imports will remain the same
